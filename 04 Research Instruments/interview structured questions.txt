Interview Questions:

Have you previously worked on or researched IoT systems involving communication protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee, or BLE? If yes, please mention which protocol(s).

In your experience, what are the most common security or privacy weaknesses in IoT communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, BLE, Zigbee)?

How critical do you consider these vulnerabilities in the context of assistive devices for visually impaired users?

Minor

Moderate

Serious

Critical

From your professional view, which transport layers (TCP, UDP, DTLS) are most reliable for secure IoT communication in low-power or wearable systems, and why?

Which security measures do you find most effective for protecting IoT data streams?

In your opinion, what is the main challenge in implementing these security measures in assistive or low-cost IoT devices?

Do you believe that current IoT standards sufficiently address privacy-by-design principles for vulnerable users (e.g., visually impaired people)?

How do you think security features (e.g., encryption, multi-factor authentication) impact the usability or accessibility of assistive devices?

What would you recommend as key priorities for future IoT assistive device design—balancing security, privacy, and accessibility?
